> A fun and interactive Discord bot that lets you play a curated collection of sounds right in your voice channel! Perfect for adding some personality, humor, or surprises to your server‚Äôs conversations. Developed as a fun passion project for my own servers with friends, which I have decided to make available to anyone!
